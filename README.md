# GitGrade – AI-Powered GitHub Repository Evaluator

**Hackathon**: GitGrade Hackathon by UnsaidTalks  
**Theme**: AI + Code Analysis + Developer Profiling

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

GitGrade is an intelligent system that evaluates GitHub repositories and converts them into:

1. A meaningful **SCORE / RATING** (0–100, Bronze / Silver / Gold)  
2. A concise **WRITTEN SUMMARY** highlighting strengths and weaknesses  
3. A **PERSONALIZED IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP** with actionable steps  

The goal is to help **students, recruiters, mentors, and hackathon evaluators** quickly understand the real quality of a GitHub project.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Multi-Dimensional Evaluation
- **Code Quality & Structure** (15 points)
- **Documentation Quality** (15 points)
- **Development Consistency** (15 points)
- **Commit Message Quality** (10 points)
- **Test Coverage** (20 points)
- **CI/CD Implementation** (10 points)
- **Real-world Relevance** (15 points)

### 🤖 Intelligent Analysis
- Fetches repository data via GitHub REST API (no cloning required)
- Analyzes file structure, commit history, and README quality
- Detects test files, CI/CD configurations, and best practices
- Uses transparent, explainable scoring logic

### 🧠 AI-Style Outputs
- Honest, mentor-like summary (strengths + gaps)
- Personalized improvement roadmap
- Actionable, priority-based guidance

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (GitHub Pages)
- **Data Source**: GitHub REST API

> In a production-ready setup, a backend proxy (Node.js / Flask) can be added to securely handle GitHub tokens and avoid API rate limits.

---

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1️⃣ Input
User provides a public GitHub repository URL:

### 2️⃣ Data Collection
Fetched via GitHub API:
- Repository metadata (stars, forks, description)
- Commit history
- File and folder structure
- README content

### 3️⃣ Analysis & Scoring (Rule-Based)

| Criteria   | Max Points | Evaluation Method |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| README    | 15 | Length, clarity, completeness |
| Structure | 15 | Folder organization, configs |
| Commits   | 15 | Frequency & consistency |
| Messages  | 10 | Meaningful commit messages |
| Tests     | 20 | Test file detection |
| CI/CD     | 10 | Pipeline config detection |
| Relevance | 15 | Description & project intent |

### 4️⃣ Output Generation

**Rating System**
- 0–59 → Beginner (Bronze)
- 60–79 → Intermediate (Silver)
- 80–100 → Advanced (Gold)

**Sample Result**
Score: 78/100 (Silver – Intermediate)

Summary:
Strong, well-organized structure with consistent development activity;
needs improvement in testing and CI/CD setup.

Roadmap:
• [High] Implement comprehensive testing
• [High] Improve README documentation
• [Medium] Add CI/CD using GitHub Actions
• [Medium] Improve commit message quality

## ⚠️ Known Limitation (Important)

The live demo may sometimes show a **timeout error**.

### Reason
- This is currently a **frontend-only application**
- GitHub allows only **60 unauthenticated API requests/hour**
- Evaluating a repository requires multiple API calls

### Production-Ready Solution
- Add a **backend proxy (Node.js / Flask)**
- Store GitHub token securely using environment variables
- Increase rate limit to **5000 requests/hour**

This limitation is acknowledged and addressed at the system design level.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- No API keys are exposed in the frontend
- Tokens are intentionally not hard-coded
- Backend-based secure token handling is recommended

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GitHub REST API

---

## 🎓 Educational Value
- Helps developers understand repository quality metrics
- Encourages best practices (testing, CI/CD, documentation)
- Useful for portfolio improvement and self-review
