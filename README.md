## 🎯 Project Overview

GitGrade is an intelligent system that evaluates GitHub repositories and converts them into:

1. A meaningful **SCORE / RATING** (0–100, Bronze / Silver / Gold)  
2. A concise **WRITTEN SUMMARY** highlighting strengths and weaknesses  
3. A **PERSONALIZED IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP** with actionable steps  

The goal is to help **students, recruiters, mentors, and hackathon evaluators** quickly understand the real quality of a GitHub project.
